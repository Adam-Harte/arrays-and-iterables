    <h1>Arrays & Iterables</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays and Iterables are objects the contain the iterable protocol method
      and can therfore be looped over. Arrays and Array like objects are lists
      of data that have a lenght prperty and data can be accessed via indexes.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      arrays can be created in a declarations by just passing the array bracket
      syntax e.g. []. You can also create arrays using the Array constructor
      function. When you use the Array constructor function and only pass in one
      argument as a number it will create an array with x number of empty slots
      of the argument number given. Finally you can use the Array.of method
      which creates an array of a sepcific length. You can also convert array
      like objects such as strings or nodeLists to actual arrays by using the
      Array.from method and passing in the array like object.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding and Removing Elements</h3>
    <p>
      there are built in methods of the Array prototype for adding and removing
      elements of an array. The methods push and unshift add elements to the
      array, adding at the end and start of the array respectively. Array
      methods pop and shift remove elements from the array, removing from the
      end and start of the array respectively. The splice method can both add
      and remove elements depending on the arguments you pass to it. All these
      arrays are mutative meaning they mutate/change the existing array rather
      than creating a new array.
    </p>
    <h3>Selecting Ranges and Copying</h3>
    <p>
      The slice method allows us to select a ranged chunk of an array or copy it
      altogether. The method takes two parameters one for the start point to
      slice and one for the end point. If you call the method with no arguments
      then it copies the array it is being called on. The slice method is
      immutable in that it does not mutate/change the original array and instead
      returns a new array with the values it takes based on the argument you
      pass.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding Arrays to Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      The concat method lets you concat/add an array to the end of another
      array. It takes arguments for what arrays to add and then returns a new
      array as the result hence making it immutable.
    </p>
    <h3>Finding Indexes and Element Values</h3>
    <p>
      The indexOf and lastIndexOf methods allows us to get the index of the
      first matching value in the array based on the passed argument. This will
      work for primitve values but not reference values as for example a passed
      object as an argument is not the same address in memory as the object
      array element value. We also have the find and findIndex methos which take
      a callback function that gets executed on every array element and the
      return should be a boolean based on what you want to find. -1 is returned
      if no matching element value is found.
    </p>
