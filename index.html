    <h1>Arrays & Iterables</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays and Iterables are objects the contain the iterable protocol method
      and can therfore be looped over. Arrays and Array like objects are lists
      of data that have a lenght prperty and data can be accessed via indexes.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      arrays can be created in a declarations by just passing the array bracket
      syntax e.g. []. You can also create arrays using the Array constructor
      function. When you use the Array constructor function and only pass in one
      argument as a number it will create an array with x number of empty slots
      of the argument number given. Finally you can use the Array.of method
      which creates an array of a sepcific length. You can also convert array
      like objects such as strings or nodeLists to actual arrays by using the
      Array.from method and passing in the array like object.
