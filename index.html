    <h1>Arrays & Iterables</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays and Iterables are objects the contain the iterable protocol method
      and can therfore be looped over. Arrays and Array like objects are lists
      of data that have a lenght prperty and data can be accessed via indexes.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      arrays can be created in a declarations by just passing the array bracket
      syntax e.g. []. You can also create arrays using the Array constructor
      function. When you use the Array constructor function and only pass in one
      argument as a number it will create an array with x number of empty slots
      of the argument number given. Finally you can use the Array.of method
      which creates an array of a sepcific length. You can also convert array
      like objects such as strings or nodeLists to actual arrays by using the
      Array.from method and passing in the array like object.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding and Removing Elements</h3>
    <p>
      there are built in methods of the Array prototype for adding and removing
      elements of an array. The methods push and unshift add elements to the
      array, adding at the end and start of the array respectively. Array
      methods pop and shift remove elements from the array, removing from the
      end and start of the array respectively. The splice method can both add
      and remove elements depending on the arguments you pass to it. All these
      arrays are mutative meaning they mutate/change the existing array rather
      than creating a new array.
    </p>
    <h3>Selecting Ranges and Copying</h3>
    <p>
      The slice method allows us to select a ranged chunk of an array or copy it
      altogether. The method takes two parameters one for the start point to
      slice and one for the end point. If you call the method with no arguments
      then it copies the array it is being called on. The slice method is
      immutable in that it does not mutate/change the original array and instead
      returns a new array with the values it takes based on the argument you
      pass.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding Arrays to Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      The concat method lets you concat/add an array to the end of another
      array. It takes arguments for what arrays to add and then returns a new
      array as the result hence making it immutable.
    </p>
    <h3>Finding Indexes and Element Values</h3>
    <p>
      The indexOf and lastIndexOf methods allows us to get the index of the
      first matching value in the array based on the passed argument. This will
      work for primitve values but not reference values as for example a passed
      object as an argument is not the same address in memory as the object
      array element value. We also have the find and findIndex methos which take
      a callback function that gets executed on every array element and the
      return should be a boolean based on what you want to find. -1 is returned
      if no matching element value is found.
    </p>
    <h3>Inlcudes</h3>
    <p>
      The includes method takes an argument of the value you want to check
      exists in the array and then returns a boolean true or false.
    </p>
    <h3>Looping</h3>
    <p>
      The forEach method loops through your array with a callback function that
      gets executed on each vlaue of the array where you can apply any logic you
      want in that function. This can be a useful alternative to for loops when
      you need access to array data such as the index.
    </p>
    <h3>Transforming Data</h3>
    <p>
      The map method allows us to transform data from an array into a new array.
      It takes a callback as an argument which gets exectued on each array item
      and then return the new value to a new array. As this method returns us a
      new array it is immutable.
    </p>
    <h3>Sorting and Reversing</h3>
    <p>
      The sort method is used to sort an array based on logic you add in the
      callback function as an argument where you return numbers 1, 0 or -1
      depending on how you want array elements to be sorted/moved. The reverse
      method reverses an array so the first element is now the last and the last
      is now the first etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Filtering</h3>
    <p>
      The filter method takes a callback as an argument which gets executed on
      every array element and you must return true or false depending on if you
      want that element filtered out. The result is returned in a new array
      therefore making the method immutable.
    </p>
    <h3>Reduce</h3>
    <p>
      The reduce method takes a callback function as an argument that gets
      executed on every array element and is used to calculate a final return
      value. The callback takes arguments for the previous value, current value
      and the reduce method takes a second argument for the starting value e.g.
      to move data to an object set starting value to empty object {}.The return
      value can be any value you want whether its primitives such as numbers or
      strings or reference types like objects and arrays. This function is
      usefull for tranaforming arrays into one piece of data such as summing up
      an array of numbers or changing the shape of the data such as taking the
      array and transform the values into an object.
    </p>
    <h3>Split and Join</h3>
    <p>
      The split method is a method of the string prototype and it takes an
      argument of how to split the string into an array. The join method is an
      Array method for joining an array into a string; These methods are handy
      for formatting strings such as reversing a string or taking it into an
      array first to transform it and then joining it back together.
    </p>
    <h3>Array Spreading</h3>
    <p>
      The spread operator allows you to spread all elements of an array out into
      a new array. This is useful for copying arrays or adding arrays onto other
      arrays. You can also spread an array to meet the requirmenets of a
      functions arguments for example Math min and max both take numbers to
      check for min and max so we can pass a spread array of numbers as the
      argument.
    </p>
    <h3>Array Desctructuring</h3>
    <p>
      The syntax for array destructuring allows you to give array index access
      speicfic variable names so you can access index 0 data with a variable
      name for example rather than with array[0]. The syntax is the array
      brackets [] after the const with each variable name inside representng
      each element value in the array e.g. const [ one, two ] = array. If you
      want to collect remaining elements of an array in destrcturing you can do
      so by using the spread operator along with the name for the variable e.g.
      const [ one, two, ...others ] = array.
